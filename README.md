**Every Code** (Code for short) is a fast, local coding agent for your terminal. It's a community-driven fork of `openai/codex` focused on real developer ergonomics: Browser integration, multi-agents, theming, and reasoning control — all while staying compatible with upstream.

&ensp;
## Hacker fork

This repository is Shreyas Chavhan's personalized `hacker` fork of Every Code. It is intended for local security research, bug bounty work, and general high-stakes agent workflows where the assistant's process needs to be reviewed, not just its file diffs.

Local builds can be exposed as:

```bash
hacker
```

or through any existing `coder` shim that points at the rebuilt `code-rs/target/release/code` binary.

Personal fork additions:

- **ProcessProbe review** - selectively launches a read-only process review agent for high-risk final conclusions, failed-tool-followed-by-confidence cases, security closure claims, and manual phrases such as `force probe`, `probe this`, or `review my reasoning`.
- **Not security-only** - ProcessProbe has general, security, and debugging profiles, so it can review unsupported confidence in ordinary coding, research, debugging, and report-writing tasks too.
- **Cheap trigger gate first** - the probe is not run on every turn. It uses the final answer plus process signals such as tool failures, validation signals, file changes, and agent events before escalating to a full review.
- **Post-turn correction loop** - when ProcessProbe says resolution is required, the TUI injects a follow-up developer instruction so the main assistant must resolve or downgrade the prior conclusion before treating it as stable.
- **Working-state visibility** - the responding/thinking/tool-use status now includes elapsed time and escalates to "Still working" messaging on long runs.
- **Compact checkpoint prompt** - the default compaction prompt now asks for a concise, factual handoff with decisions, constraints, next steps, blockers, and validation needs.

ProcessProbe is configured in `~/.code/config.toml`:

```toml
[probe_review]
enabled = true
mode = "high_risk"              # high_risk | manual | always
default_profile = "general"     # general | security | debugging
cheap_gate = true
full_probe_threshold = "high"   # low | medium | high
auto_resolve = true
use_chat_model = false
model = ""                      # empty: auto-review/review/chat fallback
model_reasoning_effort = "high"
```

&ensp;
## What's new

- **Latest long-session stability sweep** (post-0.6): Auto Drive and Auto Review are now decoupled so background reviews no longer block the command flow. `Esc` returns control immediately and typing works while review finalization continues.

- **Operational upgrades in this cycle**
  - Auto Review metadata (branch/worktree context) remains queryable through the active Auto Drive session after completion.
  - Terminal agents are compacted and archived so heavy payloads are reduced while review linkage is preserved.
  - Core `core`, coordinator, and TUI state maps now have hard caps with bounded drop/trim behavior.
  - Auto Drive conversation/update queues are bounded in the coordinator; TUI has bounded prompt/agent/runtime caches.
  - Background review notes are added as non-blocking history-visible notes instead of foreground task-injection.
  - TUI housekeeping lifecycle is bounded with deterministic stop control.
  - Stress tests now cover heavy agent churn plus concurrent Auto Review + Esc/typing responsiveness.

- **New/updated models and agents**
  - Auto Drive CLI model support defaults to `gpt-5.5` (planning/problem-solving) and `gpt-5.4-mini` (fast coding/fix loops), with `medium | high | xhigh` reasoning controls.
  - Frontline and alias-aware agent model handling now includes `code-gpt-5.5`, `code-gpt-5.4`, `claude-opus-4.8`, and `claude-sonnet-4.6`, with compatibility aliases for older model names where supported.
  - Auto Drive decision schema and coordinator payloads now enforce bounded history while preserving goal and recent context.

  See commit `60727b068` and related Auto Drive hardening commits in git history for details.


- **Auto Review** – background ghost-commit watcher runs reviews in a separate worktree whenever a turn changes code; uses `codex-5.1-mini-high` and reports issues plus ready-to-apply fixes without blocking the main thread.
- **Code Bridge** – Sentry-style local bridge that streams errors, console, screenshots, and control from running apps into Code; ships an MCP server; install by asking Code to pull `https://github.com/just-every/code-bridge`.
- **Plays well with Auto Drive** – reviews run in parallel with long Auto Drive tasks so quality checks land while the flow keeps moving.
- **Quality-first focus** – the release shifts emphasis from "can the model write this file" to "did we verify it works".
- _From v0.5.0:_ rename to Every Code, upgraded `/auto` planning/recovery, unified `/settings`, faster streaming/history with card-based activity, and more reliable `/resume` + `/undo`.

&ensp;
## Quickstart

### Run

```bash
npx -y @just-every/code
```

### Install & Run

```bash
npm install -g @just-every/code
code // or `coder` if you're using VS Code
```

Note: If another tool already provides a `code` command (e.g. VS Code), our CLI is also installed as `coder`. Use `coder` to avoid conflicts.

**Authenticate** (one of the following):
- **Sign in with ChatGPT** (Plus/Pro/Team; uses models available to your plan)
  - Run `code` and pick "Sign in with ChatGPT"
- **API key** (usage-based)
  - Set `export OPENAI_API_KEY=xyz` and run `code`

### Install Claude, Antigravity & Gemini (optional)

Every Code supports orchestrating other AI CLI tools. Install these and config to use alongside Code.

```bash
# Ensure Node.js 20+ is available locally (installs into ~/.n)
npm install -g n
export N_PREFIX="$HOME/.n"
export PATH="$N_PREFIX/bin:$PATH"
n 20.18.1

# Install the companion CLIs
export npm_config_prefix="${npm_config_prefix:-$HOME/.npm-global}"
mkdir -p "$npm_config_prefix/bin"
export PATH="$npm_config_prefix/bin:$PATH"
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code @google/gemini-cli @qwen-code/qwen-code
curl -fsSL https://antigravity.google/cli/install.sh | bash

# Quick smoke tests
claude --version
agy --version
gemini --version
qwen --version
```

> ℹ️ Add `export N_PREFIX="$HOME/.n"` and `export PATH="$N_PREFIX/bin:$PATH"` (plus the `npm_config_prefix` bin path) to your shell profile so the CLIs stay on `PATH` in future sessions.

&ensp;
## Commands

### Browser
```bash
# Connect code to external Chrome browser (running CDP)
/chrome        # Connect with auto-detect port
/chrome 9222   # Connect to specific port

# Switch to internal browser mode
/browser       # Use internal headless browser
/browser https://example.com  # Open URL in internal browser
```

### Agents
```bash
# Plan code changes (Claude, Gemini and GPT-5 consensus)
# All agents review task and create a consolidated plan
/plan "Stop the AI from ordering pizza at 3AM"

# Solve complex problems (Claude, Gemini and GPT-5 race)
# Fastest preferred (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17813)
/solve "Why does deleting one user drop the whole database?"

# Write code! (Claude, Gemini and GPT-5 consensus)
# Creates multiple worktrees then implements the optimal solution
/code "Show dark mode when I feel cranky"
```

### Auto Drive
```bash
# Hand off a multi-step task; Auto Drive will coordinate agents and approvals
/auto "Refactor the auth flow and add device login"

# Resume or inspect an active Auto Drive run
/auto status
```

### General
```bash
# Try a new theme!
/themes

# Change reasoning level
/reasoning low|medium|high

# Switch models or effort presets
/model

# Start new conversation
/new
```

## CLI reference

```shell
code [options] [prompt]

Options:
  --model <name>        Override the model for the active provider (e.g. gpt-5.1)
  --read-only          Prevent file modifications
  --no-approval        Skip approval prompts (use with caution)
  --config <key=val>   Override config values
  --oss                Use local open source models
  --sandbox <mode>     Set sandbox level (read-only, workspace-write, etc.)
  --help              Show help information
  --debug             Log API requests and responses to file
  --version           Show version number
```

Note: `--model` only changes the model name sent to the active provider. To use a different provider, set `model_provider` in `config.toml`. Providers must expose an OpenAI-compatible API (Chat Completions or Responses).

&ensp;
## Memory & project docs

Every Code can remember context across sessions:

1. **Create an `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` file** in your project root:
```markdown
# Project Context
This is a React TypeScript application with:
- Authentication via JWT
- PostgreSQL database
- Express.js backend

## Key files:
- `/src/auth/` - Authentication logic
- `/src/api/` - API client code  
- `/server/` - Backend services
```

2. **Session memory**: Every Code maintains conversation history
3. **Codebase analysis**: Automatically understands project structure

&ensp;
## Non-interactive / CI mode

For automation and CI/CD:

```shell
# Run a specific task
code --no-approval "run tests and fix any failures"

# Generate reports
code --read-only "analyze code quality and generate report"

# Batch processing
code --config output_format=json "list all TODO comments"
```

&ensp;
## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Every Code supports MCP for extended capabilities:

- **File operations**: Advanced file system access
- **Database connections**: Query and modify databases
- **API integrations**: Connect to external services
- **Custom tools**: Build your own extensions

Configure MCP in `~/.code/config.toml` Define each server under a named table like `[mcp_servers.<name>]` (this maps to the JSON `mcpServers` object used by other clients):

```toml
[mcp_servers.filesystem]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/project"]
```

&ensp;
## Configuration

Main config file: `~/.code/config.toml`

> [!NOTE]
> Every Code reads from both `~/.code/` and `~/.codex/` for backwards compatibility, but it only writes updates to `~/.code/`. If you switch back to Codex and it fails to start, remove `~/.codex/config.toml`. If Every Code appears to miss settings after upgrading, copy your legacy `~/.codex/config.toml` into `~/.code/`.

```toml
# Model settings
model = "gpt-5.1"
model_provider = "openai"

# Behavior
approval_policy = "on-request"  # untrusted | on-failure | on-request | never
model_reasoning_effort = "medium" # low | medium | high
sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"

# UI preferences see THEME_CONFIG.md
[tui.theme]
name = "light-photon"

# Add config for specific models
[profiles.gpt-5]
model = "gpt-5.1"
model_provider = "openai"
approval_policy = "never"
model_reasoning_effort = "high"
model_reasoning_summary = "detailed"
```

### Environment variables

- `CODE_HOME`: Override config directory location
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Use API key instead of ChatGPT auth
- `OPENAI_BASE_URL`: Use OpenAI-compatible API endpoints (chat or responses)
- `OPENAI_WIRE_API`: Force the built-in OpenAI provider to use `chat` or `responses` wiring

&ensp;
## FAQ

**How is this different from the original?**
> This fork adds browser integration, multi-agent commands (`/plan`, `/solve`, `/code`), theme system, and enhanced reasoning controls while maintaining full compatibility.

**Can I use my existing Codex configuration?**
> Yes. Every Code reads from both `~/.code/` (primary) and legacy `~/.codex/` directories. We only write to `~/.code/`, so Codex will keep running if you switch back; copy or remove legacy files if you notice conflicts.

**Does this work with ChatGPT Plus?**
> Absolutely. Use the same "Sign in with ChatGPT" flow as the original.

**Is my data secure?**
> Yes. Authentication stays on your machine, and we don't proxy your credentials or conversations.
